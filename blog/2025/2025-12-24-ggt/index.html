We will approach this topic through the lens of how we can build a “Cayley graph” to represent a group given a set of generators. We will also discuss the word problem on groups, and about how thinking about a graph as a metric space can help us answer algorithmic questions.</p> <p><em>“One of my personal beliefs is that fascination with symmetries and groups is one way of coping with frustrations of life’s limitations: we like to recognize symmetries which allow us to recognize more than what we can see.”</em></p> <ul> <li>Pierre de la Harpe, <em>Topics in Geometric Group Theory</em> </li> </ul> <p>\section{Groups}</p> <p>The two mathematical objects that we are going to examine and relate are groups and graphs. Let’s first familiarize ourselves with the notion of a group through examples.</p> <p>A group is essentially a set in which the elements of the set have nice properties under some group “operation”, that help to give the set more structure. For example, we’ve been thinking a lot about the integers, so take the set $\mathbb{Z}$ along with the operation “+”, meaning integer addition.</p> <p>One of the properties we can observe of this set in terms of our chosen operation is that of “closure”. This means that given two elements of the set, under the operation “+”, the result is still in the set.</p> <p>For example, take the elements $3$, $-5 \in \mathbb{Z}$. \(3 + (-5) = -2 \in \mathbb{Z}\)</p> <p>For reference, below is a more complete list of conditions that a set and its corresponding operation need to satisfy in order to be considered a group. We won’t go into these in detail.</p> </body></html>
