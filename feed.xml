We will approach this topic through the lens of how we can build a “Cayley graph” to represent a group given a set of generators. We will also discuss the word problem on groups, and about how thinking about a graph as a metric space can help us answer algorithmic questions.</p> <p><em>“One of my personal beliefs is that fascination with symmetries and groups is one way of coping with frustrations of life’s limitations: we like to recognize symmetries which allow us to recognize more than what we can see.”</em></p> <p style="text-align: right;"> Pierre de la Harpe, <i>Topics in Geometric Group Theory</i> </p> <h2 id="groups">Groups</h2> <p>The two mathematical objects that we are going to examine and relate are groups and graphs. Let’s first familiarize ourselves with the notion of a group through examples.</p> <p>A group is essentially a set in which the elements of the set have nice properties under some group “operation”, that help to give the set more structure. For example, we’ve been thinking a lot about the integers, so take the set $\mathbb{Z}$ along with the operation “+”, meaning integer addition.</p> <p>One of the properties we can observe of this set in terms of our chosen operation is that of “closure”. This means that given two elements of the set, under the operation “+”, the result is still in the set.</p> <p>For example, take the elements $3$, $-5 \in \mathbb{Z}$. \(3 + (-5) = -2 \in \mathbb{Z}\)</p> <p>For reference, below is a more complete list of conditions that a set and its corresponding operation need to satisfy in order to be considered a group. We won’t go into these in detail.</p> <p>$\underline{Defn}$: A <strong>group</strong> $G=(S, \star)$ is a set $S$ together with a binary operation $\star$ where the following properties hold:</p> <ol> <li>Closure: Given any $a,b \in S$, we have $a \star b \in S$.</li> <li>Associativity: Given any $a,b,c \in S$, we have $(a \star b) \star c =a \star (b \star c) $.</li> <li>Identity: There exists some element $e \in S$ such that for any other element $a\in S$, we have $a \star e = e \star a = a$.</li> <li>Inverses: For every $a \in S$, we have a unique $b \in S$ such that $a \star b = e$ where $e$ is the identity element explained above.</li> </ol> <p>Let’s look at a more abstract example of a group.</p> <p>$\underline{Defn}$: The <strong>free group</strong> $F_S$ over some generating set $S$ is the set of all $\mathbf{words}$ from $S$, meaning concatenations of elements of $S$ and/or their inverses.</p> <p>For example, take the free group over a generating set with two elements, $S={a,b}$. Then some words in the free group over $S$ might be: \(ab, \ ababba, \ a^{-1}bba, \ b^{-1}a\)</p> <p>\textit{This wording of a ``generating” set is nice in the sense that by combining elements of the set, we can generate the full group (by definition). We can extend these notions of generators and words to groups in general.}</p> <p>\underline{Defn}: A \textbf{generating set} $S \subset G$ for some group G is a subset of elements such that we can get any element of $G$ using words from $S$. \bigskip</p> <p>Now take for example, the finite group $D_4$, or the group of symmetries of the square. Consider a square with labels added to the corners for the purpose of keeping track of otherwise indistinguishable shifts in orientation:</p> <p><strong>(INSERT ggt-im-1)</strong></p> <p>The elements of $D_4$ correspond to ways in which we can move the square by flipping or rotating it, so that we end up with a square of the same orientation. Using the numbers at the corners, we can construct a finite set of moves based on how the square has moved in relation to its starting position.</p> <p>We define $D_4 = {R_0, R_{90}, R_{180}, R_{270}, H, V, D, D’}$, where $R_i$ represents a counterclockwise rotation of $i^{\circ}$ and the other elements represent reflections across the horizontal, vertical, and diagonal axes.</p> <p>Below is an example word, which we denote $R_{90}H$ (where the group operation is doing the moves corresponding to each element from left to right):</p> ]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Notes written for an audience of advanced high school students during the PROMYS program in July 2025.]]></summary></entry></feed>
